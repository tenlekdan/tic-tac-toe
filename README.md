## How to Play

The rules of Tic Tac Toe are simple:

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in single-player mode) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.
